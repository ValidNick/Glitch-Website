              Our project goal is to spread awareness on mental health such as
              illnesses and even basic things like stress. <br />
              We strive to do this through coding, hence code the movement, and
              to do so we must first understand our own topic. <br />In this
              case, what is mental health? What is detrimental about it? And how
              can we help to improve it?

          <p>A few basic pieces of information about Mental Health</p>
          <p>
            Our emotional, psychological, and social well-being are all part of
            our mental health. It has an impact on the way we think, feel, and
            act. It also influences how we deal with stress, interact with
            people, and make good decisions. Mental health is vital at all
            stages of life, including childhood, adolescence, and maturity.
          </p>

          <br />
          <p>
            Both mental and physical health are essential components of complete
            well-being. Depression, for example, raises the risk of a variety of
            physical health issues, especially long-term diseases like diabetes,
            heart disease, and stroke. In the same way, the existence of chronic
            illnesses can raise the risk of mental disease
          </p>

          <br />
          <p>Why is it Concerning?</p>

          <p>
            In the United States, mental diseases are among the most common
            health problems. The statistics reported by the CDC is 1 IN 5!!! At
            some point in their lives, more than half of people will be
            diagnosed with a mental illness or problem. In any given year, one
            out of every five Americans will suffer from a mental disease. A
            serious debilitating mental disease has affected one out of every
            five youngsters, either now or at some point in their lives. A
            significant mental illness, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder,
            or major depression, affects one in every twenty-five Americans.
          </p>

          <br />
          <p>
            Poor mental health and mental illness are not synonymous, despite
            the fact that the terms are frequently used interchangeably. A
            person's mental health can deteriorate without being diagnosed with
            a mental condition. A person suffering from a mental illness can
            also go through times of physical, mental, and social well-being.
          </p>
          <br />

          <p>
            There are various kinds of mental issues. A few examples of the most
            common ones include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Dietary issues</li>
            <li>Sorrow, bipolar turmoil, and other state of mind issues</li>
            <li>
              Anxiety problems, including fanatical urgent issue, and fears
            </li>
            <li>Behavioral conditions</li>
            <li>Post-horrendous pressure issue</li>
            <li>Maniacal problems, including schizophrenia</li>

          <h2>Ways to Combat Mental Health:</h2>
          <p>
            Self-care entails taking the time to do activities that will help
            you live a happy and healthy life, both physically and mentally.
            Self-care can help you manage stress, reduce your risk of illness,
            and boost your energy levels when it comes to your mental health.
            Even little actions of self-care performed on a daily basis can have
            a significant impact.
          </p>

          <br />

          <p>
            Treatment depends on the mental illness you have and how serious it
            is. You and your healthcare provider will work on a treatment plan
            just for you. It usually involves some kind of treatment. You can
            also take medicine. Some people also need social support and
            education to deal with their illness. In some cases, more intensive
            treatment may be required. You may need to go to a mental hospital.
            This may be due to your mental illness being serious. Or it may be
            because you risk injuring yourself or others. The hospital offers
            counseling, group discussions and activities with mental health
            professionals and other patients.
